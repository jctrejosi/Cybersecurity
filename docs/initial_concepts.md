## ðŸ”¸ CIA Model (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

### Confidentiality

**Definition:**

Information must not be altered without authorization.

**Example:**
A financial report altered by an attacker breaks integrity. Hashes or digital signatures can detect this.

### Availability

Systems and data must be accessible when needed.

**Example:**
A DDoS attack that takes down an online storeâ€™s website affects availability.
